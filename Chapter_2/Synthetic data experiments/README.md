# Dataset:
A sample of the dataset can be created using the function sample_gen_Grid2D(batch_size, n_mixture=25, std=0.05) or sample_gen_ring2D(batch_size, n_mixture=8, std=0.01, radius=1.0) from [utils.py](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_VARGAN/blob/main/Synthetic%20data%20experiments/utils.py) file.
The first function creates a synthetic grid data with 25 modes and the second one creates a 2D ring with 8 modes.
# Training:
You can train the model by calling [run_multiple_experiments.py](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_VARGAN/blob/main/Synthetic%20data%20experiments/run_multiple_exps.py). Set the configuration details as you wish.
