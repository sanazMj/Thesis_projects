# Dataset:
The stacked version of MNIST data can be created by calling load_data_create(num_training_sample, img_size) function from [utils.py](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_VARGAN/blob/main/Stacked%20MNIST%20experiments/utils.py).
# Training:
You can train the model by calling [run_multiple_exp.py](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_VARGAN/blob/main/Stacked%20MNIST%20experiments/run_multiple_exp.py). Set the configuration details as you wish.
