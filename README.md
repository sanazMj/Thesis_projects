This repository contains the code for the three chapters of my PhD thesis, called "Novel Generative Adversarial Network Architectures for Generating Discrete Image Data".
## Chapter 1. [Understanding the capabilities and usefulness of GANs for novel real-world applications.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_1)

This chapter contains the codes for the following publication:

Mohammadjafari, S., Ozyegen, O., Cevik, M., Kavurmacioglu, E., Ethier, J. and Basar, A., 2021. Designing mm-wave electromagnetic engineered surfaces using generative adversarial networks. Neural Computing and Applications, 33(17), pp.11309-11323.

## Chapter 2. [Designing novel GAN architectures to address the mode collapse.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_2)
This chapter contains the codes for the following publication:

Mohammadjafari, S., Cevik, M. \& Basar, A. VARGAN: variance enforcing network enhanced GAN, Applied Intelligence (2022). http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-03199-8
## Chapter 3. [Designing 3D GAN structures for augmenting 3D connected volumes.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_3)
This chapter contains the codes for the following study that is currently under review:
