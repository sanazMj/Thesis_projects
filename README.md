This repository contains the code for the three chapters of my PhD thesis, called "Novel Generative Adversarial Network Architectures for Generating Discrete Image Data".
## Chapter 1. [Understanding the capabilities and usefulness of GANs for novel real-world applications.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_1)
## Chapter 2. [Designing novel GAN architectures to address the mode collapse.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_2)
## Chapter 3. [Designing 3D GAN structures for augmenting 3D connected volumes.](https://github.com/sanazMj/Thesis_projects/tree/main/Chapter_3)
