# Thesis_projects
This repository contains the code for the three chapters of my PhD thesis, called "Novel Generative Adversarial Network Architectures for Generating Discrete Image Data".
## Chapter 1. Understanding the capabilities and usefulness of GANs for novel real-world applications. [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
## Chapter 2. Designing novel GAN architectures to address the mode collapse.
## Chapter 3. Designing 3D GAN structures for augmenting 3D connected volumes.
