# Repository structure

There are two folders available, each containing the codes for different datasets. 

[GAN experiments](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_3D_tumorGAN/tree/main/GAN%20experiments) folder contains baseline GANs and AlphaWGAN experiments.

[Synthetic data generation](https://github.com/RyersonU-DataScienceLab/Sanaz_3D_tumorGAN/tree/main/Synthetic%20data%20generation) folder contains files on generating synthetic data for the paper. 

# Steps
* Use files in Synthetic data generation folder to create the synthetic data.
* Use GAN\AlphaWGAN experiments to run the models.
