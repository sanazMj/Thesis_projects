Main.py contains two sets of commands for synthetic data generation. 
* 3D connected volume with/without packed spheres generation
  * Define the sample size, dimension and number of isocenters (e.g. 7) you want to create. The created samples will be saved in .h5 file.

* 3D tumor volumes with/without packed spheres generation
  * The data samples that follow the same distribution as samples at paper, are created in Matlab.
  * The .mat files are loaded in python and saved as .h5 files.
